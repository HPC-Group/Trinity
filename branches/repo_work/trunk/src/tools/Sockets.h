// TODO
// exception types revamp -> done
// switch to NetworkAddress (see class below) instead of using local/peerAddress and local/peerPort -> done
// IOSocket extension with support for source/destination addresses (using NetworkAddress and GetNativeAddress()/SetNativeAddress() for performance reasons, instead of building sockaddr for each send) -> done
// UDPServer -> this will be removed/not implemented as functionality will be available in UDPSocket with IOSocket extension mentioned above -> done
// handle timeouts better in waitFor methods (due to accuracy issues/differences, i.e. timeout with 50, select might return 0 (timeout), but timer.Elapsed() returns 49.3, but we would expect 50+ to be returned) -> done
// probably add Bind method to Socket, otherwise localAddress/localPort makes no sense at this level -> done
// allow SO_SNDBUF and SO_RCVBUF to be set (IOSocket) -> done in Socket, SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE (ListenSocket)
// add helper functions to convert between network and host byte order -> done
// remove timeout option from Send/Receive/Int/String methods as partial results and timeouts are a mess to handle consistenly here (see comments in code) -> done
// helper functions using gethostname/gethostbyname will fail on windows without WSAStartup, so they require a Socket being created before, which affects NetworkAddress in return which uses the helper functions (restructure this)
// for NetworkAddress, INADDR_BROADCAST = INADDR_NONE, so we might want to remove usage of INADDR_NONE at all
// right now, it is not possible to set TCP_NODELAY and SO_SNDBUF/SO_RCVBUF in TCPServer which makes sense code structure wise as a TCPServer never sends or receives data and thus does not require these settinsg itself
// but TCPSockets created by the server inherit these settings, so we might want to set them for the server so there is no need to individually set them for each TCPSocket the server produces
// more important: it may not be possible to set SO_SNDBUF/SO_RCVBUF after a TCPSocket has been connected, and sockets produced by the TCPServer are connected
// above is solved by moving the mentioned settings to a higher level -> done
// at some point, implement support for a proper graceful TCP shutdown as described here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms738547%28v=VS.85%29.aspx
// probably distinguish between hard close and graceful disconnect exception type wise
// use auto/smart pointers when using new and exceptions (see CreateConnectionSocket, AcceptNewConnection in ListenSocket)
// handle SIG_PIPE signal with signal handler -> done (differently)
