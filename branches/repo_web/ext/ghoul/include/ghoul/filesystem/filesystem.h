 * The methods in this class are used to access platform-independent features of the
 * underlying filesystem. It is possible to convert relative paths into absolute paths
 * (#absolutePath()) and vice versa (#relativePath()). The current working directory
 * can be accessed and changed (#currentDirectory(), #setCurrentDirectory(), 
 * #setCurrentDirectory()). All methods that require a Directory or File parameter can use
 * an <code>std::string</code> or <code>char*</code> directly as this will be converted
 * into a lightweight Directory or File object. The main functionality of the FileSystem 
 * is to deal with path tokens. These are tokens of the form <code>${...}</code> which are
 * like variables, pointing to a specific location. These tokens are resolved in various
 * methods (for example #absolutePath()) and thus be used to dynamically set, for example,
 * asset paths with only one point of specification. These tokens can only be bound once,
 * as some of the tokens might already have been resolved and changing the tokens later
 * might lead to inconsistencies. For the same reason, it is not possible to unregister
 * tokens.
