 * Loads the texture located at <code>filename</code>, using the DevIL library, and 
 * creates a Texture object from it. For a list of supported image formats, see 
 * http://openil.sourceforge.net/features.php. If an image can not be loaded, a null
 * pointer is returned and an error is logged. Otherwise a Texture of appropriate 
 * format is created and returned. The ownership of the texture passes to the caller. The 
 * Texture will not automatically be uploaded to the graphics card.

 * \param useCompression <code>true</code> if the returned Texture should be in a 
 * compressed format. <code>false</code> will use a non-compressed format
