# This module locates the developer's image library.
# http://openil.sourceforge.net/
#
# This module sets:
#   IL_LIBRARIES -   the name of the IL library. These include the full path to
#                    the core DevIL library. This one has to be linked into the
#                    application.
#   ILU_LIBRARIES -  the name of the ILU library. Again, the full path. This
#                    library is for filters and effects, not actual loading. It
#                    doesn't have to be linked if the functionality it provides
#                    is not used.
#   ILUT_LIBRARIES - the name of the ILUT library. Full path. This part of the
#                    library interfaces with OpenGL. It is not strictly needed
#                    in applications.
#   IL_INCLUDE_DIR - where to find the il.h, ilu.h and ilut.h files.
#   IL_FOUND -       this is set to TRUE if all the above variables were set.
#                    This will be set to false if ILU or ILUT are not found,
#                    even if they are not needed. In most systems, if one
#                    library is found all the others are as well. That's the
#                    way the DevIL developers release it.
